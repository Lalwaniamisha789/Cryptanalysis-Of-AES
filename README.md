# Cryptanalysis of AES: Yoyo and Boomerang Attacks (C Implementation)

## Description:
This project provides C-based implementations of cryptanalytic attacks on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), focusing on two methods: the Yoyo attack and the Boomerang attack. These techniques exploit weaknesses in reduced-round AES to recover secret keys and distinguish AES from random permutations.

---

## Features:
- **Yoyo Attack** on 3- to 5-round AES: Implements key-independent distinguishers and key-recovery attacks with low computational complexity.
- **Boomerang Attack** on 6-round AES: Combines two short high-probability differentials into an effective distinguisher.

---

## Prerequisites:
- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic understanding of AES encryption
- Familiarity with cryptographic attacks
